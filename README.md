**The file contains some numeric variables (retain all of them) and many factors (restrict to 10 to
reduce the effort).**
- Exploratory Data Analysis and Model Fitting should take train sample only.
- Create factors for retained qualitative variables. Train and Test samples.
- Determine if the response variable (charges) has an acceptably normal distribution.
- Address tests to discard serial correlation.
- Detect univariant and multivariant outliers, errors and missing values (if any) and apply an
imputation technique if needed.
- Preliminary exploratory analysis to describe observed relations has to be undertaken.
- If you can improve linear relations or limit the effect of influential data, you must consider
suitable transformations for variables.
- Apart from the retained factor variables, you can consider other categorical variables that
can be defined from categorized numeric variables. Do not forget to implement new
variable definitions in the test sample.
- You must take into account possible interactions between categorical and numerical
variables.
- When building the model, you should study the presence of multicollinearity and try to
reduce their impact on the model for easier interpretation.
- You should build the model using a technique for selecting variables (removing no
significant predictors and/or stepwise selection of the best models).
- The validation of the model has to be done with graphs and / or suitable tests to verify
model assumptions.
- You must include the study of unusual and / or influential data.
- The resulting model should be interpreted in terms of the relationships of selected
predictors and its effect on the response variable.
- You have to apply your final model to the test sample and roughly assess forecasting
capability.
